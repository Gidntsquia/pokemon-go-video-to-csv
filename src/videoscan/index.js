// Video collection importer: a screen recording of Pokemon GO's appraisal
// screen in, one row per Pokemon out, in the same generic CSV shape
// src/importer already reads.
//
//   scan.swift   decode frames, OCR text, run-length encode bar pixels
//     -> frame.js   accept/reject each frame, read CP + species + IVs
//     -> group.js   collapse consecutive agreeing frames into one Pokemon
//     -> level.js   derive the level, and cross-check CP/HP against the IVs
//     -> csv.js     write name,atk,def,sta,shadow,level,cp
//
// What is read from where:
//   CP       the "CP 1498" text above the Pokemon (Vision OCR)
//   species  the caught-location caption ("This Trevenant was caught on...")
//            -- never the name above the stats, which is the trainer's own
//            nickname and is usually a rank percentage
//   IVs      the three appraisal bars, measured in pixels (see bars.js)
//   level    solved for, from species + IVs + CP + max HP (see level.js)
//   shadow   the colour of the action button showing above the appraisal
//            panel -- pink PURIFY or green POWER UP (see purify.js)
//
// Recording advice worth passing on to a user: open the appraisal, and rest
// about a second on each Pokemon before swiping. Frames mid-swipe are thrown
// away by design.
